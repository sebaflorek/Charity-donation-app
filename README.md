> Welcome to web application that allows you to give away unnecessary things to trusted institutions.

## About Charity Donation App

The general idea of this application is to create a place where everyone will be able to give away unnecessary things to
verified and trusted institutions with few simple steps.

### Where did the idea come from?

Judging by our research and observations, almost everyone has things at home that they do not need anymore while they
are still in good condition. Many of those people want to give those things to others in need, but they do not know
how to do it easily.

There are many solutions available, but many of them require extra effort, or they are untrustworthy. Verified places
need to be driven, and there is no time or no way to go there. On the other hand, local containers under the house or
local
collections are often unverified, and it is not known whether these things will actually go to those in need.

### How does it work?

The idea is to make a donation process as easy as possible. Register to our website and make a donation with few simple
steps.

**Step 1** - choose things to give and tell us what they are.

**Step 2** - pack the returned items into 60l bags and provide us with the amount of the donated items.

**Step 3** - choose one of our verified and trusted foundations.

**Step 4** - provide us with contact details, so we can send a courier at the specified time to the address indicated.

**Step 5** - confirm the donation and hand over the items at the indicated place and time.
